== 1. Introduction ==

The Wiki Email Notification extension provides a clean mean to send email messages to one or more registered 
users upon the creation of a user account or when a new page is created or an existing page is edited . Some
options can be configured in the LocalSettings.php file for MediaWiki.

== 2. Installation requirements ==

This extension requires MediaWiki 1.35.0 or later.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a WikiNotif/ directory within your MediaWiki extensions/ 
directory, then edit LocalSettings.php and add the following line

	wfLoadExtension( 'WikiNotif' );

== 6. Further configuration ==

The behaviour of the extension can be tweaked using three configuration
variables. To override the defaults for these, set them in LocalSettings.php
underneath the call to the extension file.

$wgWikiNotifSender
	Email address of the sender of the email

	Defaults to the value of $wgPasswordSender

$wgWikiNotifTargets
	Array containing the usernames or user IDs of those who should receive
	a notification email. Email will not be sent unless the recipient's
	email address has been validated, where this is required in the site
	configuration.

	Defaults to the first user in the wiki as this is usually the wiki's primary administrator

$wgWikiNotifEmailTargets
	Array containing email addresses to which a notification should also be sent

	Defaults to no additional addresses

== 6. Feedback ==
